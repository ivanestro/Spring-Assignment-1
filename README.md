- Collaboration with multiple users who has access to the project/assignments that can modify simultaneously without downtime.
- Version control systems has access control which is allowing user access to restrict certain parts of the project and to ensure that only authorized users can make changes.
- Version control systems provide audit trail to enable users to track changes and help with guideline standards.
